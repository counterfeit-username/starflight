This is a small game written in Java using libGDX that I'm making.
I'm targeting desktop as the platform.
This game is being developed using Java with a library called libGDX.
To build, clone the repo and run gradlew.bat which will generate the jar file at desktop/build/libs.

Current controls are:
Up arrow-accelerate forward, Left arrow-rotate counter-clockwise, Right arrow-rotate clockwise.

More Information on libGDX can be found at: https://libgdx.com/ and https://libgdx.com/wiki.
