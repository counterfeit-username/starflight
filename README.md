## About starflight
This is a small game written in Java using libGDX that I'm making.
I'm targeting desktop as the platform.
This game is being developed using Java with a library called libGDX.

## Build instructions
To build:
```
git clone https://github.com/counterfeit-username/starflight.git
gradlew desktop:dist
```
This will build the project into a .jar file at desktop/build/libs.

## Game controls
Current controls are:
Space bar: main engines forward, W key: RCS forward, S key: RCS backward, Q key: RCS left, E key: RCS right,
A key: RCS counter clockwise, and D key: RCS clockwise. (For those who don't know, RCS stands for Reaction 
Control System and is a system of small thrusters which control the position and rotation of a ship.)
