## About starflight
This is a small game written in Java using libGDX that I'm making.
I'm targeting desktop as the platform.
This game is being developed using Java with a library called libGDX.

## Build instructions
To build:
```
git clone https://github.com/counterfeit-username/starflight.git
gradlew desktop:dist
```
This will build the project into a .jar file at desktop/build/libs.

## Game controls
Current controls are:<br><br>Space bar: main engines forward,<br>W key: RCS forward,<br>S key: RCS backward,<br>Q key: RCS left,<br>E key: RCS right,<br>A key: RCS counter clockwise,<br>D key: RCS clockwise.<br><br>(For those who don't know, RCS stands for Reaction Control System and is a system of small thrusters which control the position and rotation of a ship.)
